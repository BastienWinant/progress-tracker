# Scrimba Bootcamp Progress Tracker
Bootcamp students will contribute to this open source project, where we will build an app to keep track of activity and accomplishments in the Scrimba bootcamp.

Here is some important information that should be included in a README for an open source project:

- [x] Project title and summary
- [ ] brief instructions on how to set up the project
- [ ] images of the app and code examples
- [ ] tech and tools used in the project
- [x] link to the contributing guidelines
- [ ] link to the code of conduct
- [x] link to the open source license
- [x] link to community Discord, Slack group, or GitHub Discussions

(We can remove these comments once everything has been added)
